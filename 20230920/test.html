    The snow glows white on the mountain tonight <br>
    Not a footprint to be seen <br>
    A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I’m the queen <br>
    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside <br>
    Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried <br>

    Don’t let them in, don’t let them see <br>
    Be the good girl you always have to be <br>
    Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know <br>
    Well now they know <br>

    Let it go, let it go <br>
    Can’t hold it back anymore <br>
    Let it go, let it go <br>
    Turn away and slam the door <br>
    I don’t care what they’re going to say <br>
    Let the storm rage on <br>
    The cold never bothered me anyway. <br>

    It’s funny how some distance <br>
    Makes everything seems small <br>
    And the fears that once controlled me <br>
    Can’t get to me at all <br>

    It’s time to see what I can do <br>
    To test the limits and break through <br>
    No right, no wrong, no rules for me, <br>
    I’m free <br>

    Let it go, let it go <br>
    I am one with the wind and sky <br>
    Let it go, let it go, <br>
    You’ll never see me cry <br>
    Here I stand and Here I’ll stay <br>
    Let the storm rage on… <br>

    My power flurries through the air into the ground <br>
    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around <br>
    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast <br>
    I’m never going back <br>
    The past is in the past <br>

    Let it go, let it go <br>
    And I’ll rise like the break of dawn <br>
    Let it go, let it go <br>
    That perfect girl is gone <br>
    Here I stand in the light of day <br>
    Let the storm rage on <br>
    The cold never bothered me anyway <br>
